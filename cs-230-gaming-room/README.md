# CS-230 Gaming Room Project
Reflection and documentation for The Gaming Room design document.

---

## Reflection

**1) Client & requirements**  
The client, *The Gaming Room*, wanted a web-based version of their game *Draw It or Lose It*. The application needed to support multiple teams and players, enforce unique game instances, store data centrally, scale to many users, and be secure across platforms.  

**2) What I did well**  
I did well in translating the client’s needs into clear software requirements and documenting the architecture in a way that both technical and non-technical stakeholders could understand. I especially highlighted scalability and cross-platform compatibility.  

**3) Helpful part of the design process**  
Working through the design document forced me to think ahead about the system architecture, user flows, and requirements before starting any code. This made the eventual coding process more structured and efficient.  

**4) What I would revise**  
If I could revise one part, I would improve the deployment and cost analysis section. Adding more detail about hosting options, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines would make the design even stronger for real-world use.  

**5) Interpreting user needs**  
I used the user’s requirements (multi-team, unique game instances, cross-platform support) as the foundation of the design. Considering the user’s needs is critical because it ensures the software solves the actual problem and prevents costly rework later.  

**6) My design approach & future strategies**  
I approached this project using domain modeling, layered architecture, and by recommending a Linux-based cloud deployment for cost efficiency. In the future, I would also add techniques like Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automated testing, and threat modeling to strengthen the design further.
